on p. 10 end of second paragraph from the bottom S is strictly speaking normalized to $[1/63^2,1]$
\\\\
on p. 17 midpage \textit{"...we calculate the distance from each point to the (1,0) coordinate in the diagram."}, the coordinate should be the topleft coordinate (0,1).
\\\\
on p. 20 second paragraph from the top should end with \textit{"...down to $101 \times 11 = 1111$."}
\\\\
on p. 22 the formula should read $P(x) = 1 - max(f(x,s), s \in S)$, where 
\[
f(x,s)=e^{-\frac{(x-s)^{2}}{2c^{2}}}
\]
\\
on p. 40 in the explanation after the formula \textit{"If the standard deviation of either group of vertices..."} \textit{either} should instead read \textit{both}.
\\\\
on p. 42 in the sentence "The variance in vertical movement in an area...", variance should not be understood as in the statistical meaning of the word.
\\\\
on p. 43 formula (3.6) replace $V(f)$ with $W(f)$ to avoid confusion with $V_i(f)$ in formula (3.5) as they are in no way the same.
\\\\
on p. 45 formula (3.8) should read:
\[
D=\sum_{i=1}^{\tau}H_i < \sum_{j=\tau+1}^{b}H_j
\]
\\
on p. 56 section 4.1.4 replace video with videos (plural) in the sentence \textit{"...be the set of all segments generated from the candidate video..."}
Also the formula should read (for clarification):
\[
W = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2
\]
\\
on p. 73 end of first section disregard \textit{"...was correct X\% of the time."}
