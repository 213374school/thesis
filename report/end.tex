Had we had our own video hosting service we would have access to such information.Had we further had our own client application in which all video was recorded we would even be able to acquire additional information about the circumstances in which the footage was recorded. Examples of this could be information about the movement of the camera (from accelerometers) and proximity to other devices recording the same scene (through Bluetooth). The purpose of our method for building our dataset has been to simulate that we do in fact have access to some of this information, as well as making it as easy as possible to estimate the rest.

\chapter{Conclusion}

labeling was so dependant on image quality that the quality assesment was not as much needed (other than optimizations we did not perform)
impact of generally high quality videos (pre-edited and then cut up)
gold standard is somewhat error prone
