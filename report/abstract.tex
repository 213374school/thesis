% In this project, we study the performance of local image descriptors using a recently released dataset [2] that offers unique evaluation possibilities compared to previous datasets. 
%
%Our investigation is twofold in that we evaluate current state-of-the-art descriptors and develop our own de- scriptors to explore different designs and their performance implications. The descriptors we develop are based on the locally orderless image repre- sentation and on higher-order differential structure. We show that we by the use of higher-order image structure are able to reduce the descriptor dimensionality and partly do away with the multi-local description, that has previously been considered crucial for achieving good performance. 
%
%We test the descriptors in a variety of scenarios (namely, large changes in scale, viewing angle and lighting) and find that the choice of descriptor should be based with the image data and the end application in mind.

% fra some article:
% The goal of the current paper is to introduce a novel clustering algorithm that has been designed for grouping transcribed textual documents obtained out of audio, video segments. Since audio transcripts are normally highly erroneous documents, one of the major challenges at the text processing stage is to reduce the negative impacts of errors gained at the speech recognition stage. Other difficulties come from the nature of conversational speech. In the paper we describe the main difficulties of the spoken documents and suggest an approach restricting their negative effects.
% In our paper we also present a clustering algorithm that groups transcripts on the base of informative closeness of documents. To carry out such partitioning we give an intuitive definition of “informative field of a transcript” and use it in our algorithm. To assess informative closeness of the transcripts, we apply Chi-square similarity measure, which is also described in the paper. Our experiments with Chi-square similarity measure showed its robustness and high efficacy. In particular, the performance analysis that have been carried out in regard to Chi-square and three other similarity measures such as Cosine, Dice, and Jaccard showed that Chi-square is more robust to specific features of spoken documents.

% Despite the fact that an abstract is quite brief, it must do almost as much work as the multi-page paper that follows it. In a computer architecture paper, this means that it should in most cases include the following sections. Each section is typically a single sentence, although there is room for creativity. In particular, the parts may be merged or spread among a set of sentences. Use the following as a checklist for your next abstract:
%
% Motivation:
% Why do we care about the problem and the results? If the problem isn't obviously "interesting" it might be better to put motivation first; but if your work is incremental progress on a problem that is widely recognized as important, then it is probably better to put the problem statement first to indicate which piece of the larger problem you are breaking off to work on. This section should include the importance of your work, the difficulty of the area, and the impact it might have if successful.

% Many terrabytes of video is recorded every single day, now more and more often from high-resolution mobile devices
% Almost half a billion smartphones was shipped in 2011 compared to 300 million in 2010
% YouTube alone has more than 72 hours of video uploaded every minute
% With the increased availability high speed mobile connections and rapid spread of smartphones (half a billion shipped in 2011) it is becomming more and more common that many hours of video footage is recorded at a single event
% Amateur footage increases rapidly with the increased availability of fast mobile connections and spread of smartphones
%
The amount of amateur footage has increased rapidly over the last few years, along with the high availability of fast mobile connections and extensive spread of smartphones. Much of this footage is recorded at events by different people, who later makes it available for public viewing on ex. YouTube, and it easily becomes fragmented.
%
% Problem statement:
% What problem are you trying to solve? What is the scope of your work (a generalized approach, or for a specific situation)? Be careful not to use too much jargon. In some cases it is appropriate to put the problem statement before the motivation, but usually this only works if most readers already understand why the problem is important.
% Approach:
% How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem? Did you use simulation, analytic models, prototype construction, or analysis of field data for an actual product? What was the extent of your work (did you look at one application program or a hundred programs in twenty different programming languages?) What important variables did you control, ignore, or measure?
%
In this project we study the possibilites in automated video summary generation, by assessing video image quality, and identifying contextual properties using ex. optical flow estimation and Haar Cascade Classifiers. Based on these contextual properties we generate video summaries using a custom algorithm.
%
% Results:
% What's the answer? Specifically, most good computer architecture papers conclude that something is so many percent faster, cheaper, smaller, or otherwise better than something else. Put the result there, in numbers. Avoid vague, hand-waving results such as "very", "small", or "significant." If you must be vague, you are only given license to do so when you can talk about orders-of-magnitude improvement. There is a tension here in that you should not provide numbers that can be easily misinterpreted, but on the other hand you don't have room for all the caveats.

and successfully detect public speakers, crowds, police blinker lights, and overview shots, which allowed us to generate a video summary with a solid contextual flow. Our test panel generally provided positive feedback.
%
% Conclusions:
% What are the implications of your answer? Is it going to change the world (unlikely), be a significant "win", be a nice hack, or simply serve as a road sign indicating that this path is a waste of time (all of the previous results are useful). Are your results general, potentially generalizable, or specific to a particular case?
%
In this paper we have shown that generating video summaries is both feasible (computation-wise) and ?. We were not able to measure any statistical significant effect of using our custom summary algorithm compared to a human edited summary.

% Other Considerations
%
% An abstract must be a fully self-contained, capsule description of the paper. It can't assume (or attempt to provoke) the reader into flipping through looking for an explanation of what is meant by some vague statement. It must make sense all by itself. Some points to consider include:
%
% Meet the word count limitation. If your abstract runs too long, either it will be rejected or someone will take a chainsaw to it to get it down to size. Your purposes will be better served by doing the difficult task of cutting yourself, rather than leaving it to someone else who might be more interested in meeting size restrictions than in representing your efforts in the best possible manner. An abstract word limit of 150 to 200 words is common.
% Any major restrictions or limitations on the results should be stated, if only by using "weasel-words" such as "might", "could", "may", and "seem".
% Think of a half-dozen search phrases and keywords that people looking for your work might use. Be sure that those exact phrases appear in your abstract, so that they will turn up at the top of a search result listing.
% Usually the context of a paper is set by the publication it appears in (for example, IEEE Computer magazine's articles are generally about computer technology). But, if your paper appears in a somewhat un-traditional venue, be sure to include in the problem statement the domain or topic area that it is really applicable to.
% Some publications request "keywords". These have two purposes. They are used to facilitate keyword index searches, which are greatly reduced in importance now that on-line abstract text searching is commonly used. However, they are also used to assign papers to review committees or editors, which can be extremely important to your fate. So make sure that the keywords you pick make assigning your paper to a review category obvious (for example, if there is a list of conference topics, use your chosen topic area as one of the keyword tuples).
%
% Writing an efficient abstract is hard work, but will repay you with increased impact on the world by enticing people to read your publications. Make sure that all the components of a good abstract are included in the next one you write.
